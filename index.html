language.</p><p>I am most comfortable writing web applications TypeScript for both the server and client side of the
project, but I'm willing to learn new languages and technologies if need be.</p></section><section><h1>Projects</h1><p>This is a small selection of my open source projects I think are the most interesting. The full list
can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/mattbdean">GitHub</a>.</p><h2><a href="https://mattbdean.github.io/Helium/">Helium</a></h2><div class="tag-container"><span class="tag">TypeScript</span><span class="tag">Angular</span><span class="tag">MySQL</span><span class="tag">Express.js</span></div><p> Helium is a Material Design webapp for DataJoint originally written for the Svoboda Lab located at
HHMI Janelia Research Campus. It is designed to be an extra-simple interface into any MySQL database
with extra convenience if DataJoint was used to create it. Helium is used by several labs
internationally and is the most prominent graphical interface for DataJoint.</p><p>Helium is written in TypeScript and uses Express.js and Angular to provide and consume a JSON API.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/mattbdean/novaXfer">novaXfer</a></h2><div class="tag-container"><span class="tag">TypeScript</span><span class="tag">Angular</span><span class="tag">MongoDB</span></div><p>novaXfer is a tool that allows a student with credits from the Northern Virginia Community College
(aka NOVA) quickly determine to which four-year universities their credits will transfer to.</p><p>novaXfer was initially used by my friends, but this tool's popularity gradually grew through word of
mouth. novaXfer ran for about a year, and while it's no longer actively maintained, it helped an
estimated several hundred fellow students more clearly understand which of their credits
would transfer to prominent four-year universities in the area.</p><p>novaXfer was my first "real" project with JavaScript, Express, AngularJS, and MongoDB. After learning
TypeScript and Angular, I rewrote the entire project several times as I quickly learned how to better
express my intents with JavaScript code, and once more when I migrated the app to TypeScript and the
new Angular.</p><h2><a href="https://github.com/mattbdean/JRAW">JRAW</a></h2><div class="tag-container"><span class="tag">Kotlin</span><span class="tag">Gradle</span><span class="tag">JUnit 5</span></div><p>The Java Reddit API Wrapper (JRAW) is, as its name suggests, a simplistic wrapper for the reddit API
originally written in Java. It features a simplistic, fluent API and is the most popular library
among its competitors. JRAW is a core component in several popular Android apps and has been utilized
by data scientists for personal projects.</p><p>Created in May 2014, JRAW was my very first open-source project. It went through two rewrites, one
very early in its life to migrate to a more modern HTTP library, and a second time to redesign the
API and migrate the entire project to Kotlin.</p></section><section><h1>Education</h1><div class="education-container"><div class="school"><span class="school-name">Georgia Institute of Technology</span><span class="school-loc">Atlanta, GA</span><span>Spring 2018 - Present</span></div><div class="school-connector "></div><div class="school"><span class="school-name">Northern Virginia Community College (NOVA)</span><span class="school-loc">Sterling, VA</span><span>Fall 2016 - Fall 2017</span></div><div class="school-connector "></div><div class="school"><span class="school-name">Briar Woods High School</span><span class="school-loc">Ashburn, VA</span><span>Fall 2012 - Spring 2016</span></div><div class="school-connector gone"></div></div></section><section><h1>Employment</h1><h2>Janelia Research Campus</h2><span class="subtitle">Ashburn, VA | February 2017 - Present</span><p>My current position is at the Howard Hughes Medical Instute's (HHMI) Janelia Research Campus under
the direction of <a href="https://www.janelia.org/lab/svoboda-lab">Karel Svoboda</a>. This position
requires that I am knowledgeable about TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Angular, MySQL, and MongoDB.</p><p>At the lab, I was able to optimize an internal webapp used to analyze dendritic activity in mice
brains. The website's initial load time was cut by 90% and runs smoothly even when viewing sessions
with gigabytes worth of data.</p><p>My current project is Helium, mentioned in the Projects section above. I wrote the app from scratch
and we are now focused on bug fixes, minor features, and quality of life improvements.</p><h2>Harris Teeter</h2><span class="subtitle">Ashburn, VA | July 2014 - May 2018</span><p>Harris Teeter gave my first ever job at 16 years old. I was hired as a Bagger and was given the
opportunity to work as a Cashier, a Customer Service Clerk, and a Pharmacy Technician. I consider
this period in my life pivotal to my development as a functional and well put-together adult. During
my time here I gained a work ethic, time management skills, and a deeper respect for those in the
customer service industry.</p></section></main></body></html>
